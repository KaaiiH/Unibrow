## Bouncing Boppers (Originally Fight For Frank)

**Ignore the name Unibrow for the Repo it has nothing to do with the name of the game, It was the original name for the game but the name is still a working effort**

Unibrow is a fighting game I made while trying to explore and get into SFML. It uses mainly Object Oriented C++ as well as tools from the SFML library. My original intent was to make it a smash clone but as I started coding and looking at tutorials things changed along the way. But there's still plenty room for change down the line!

Currently it can <ins>only be compiled on windows because that's what I built it on and for</ins>, but soon I will add <ins>CMake<ins> so this can be played on any OS.
